The now legendary Aqua opened to widespread acclaim in 1991 and quickly became a destination restaurant in a city that knows a thing or two about food. And Michael Mina’s reputation as one of the culinary world’s most innovative and talented chefs was born.

Now, 20 years and 19 restaurants later, the award-winning chef and restaurateur is bringing back the magic that made Aqua one of San Francisco’s top restaurants. He has opened the eponymous Michael Mina in Aqua’s former location — for him, hallowed ground.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
